      <h2>How It Works</h2>
      <br/>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you have space, sign up as a host and list your space for free. You
          can set your own price, availability, and rules for your space. You
          can also upload photos and a description of your space to attract
          renters.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you need space, sign up as a renter and browse through thousands of
          spaces near you. You can filter by location, size, price, and
          amenities. You can also read reviews and ratings from other renters to
          find the best space for you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you find a space that you like, you can book it online with a few
          clicks. You can also message the host directly to ask any questions or
          arrange a viewing.
        </li>
        <li>
          After you book a space, you can move in your belongings and access
          them anytime. You can also extend or cancel your booking anytime with
          our flexible policies.
        </li>
        <li>
          We handle all the payments and transactions securely and
          automatically. You only pay for the space that you use, and you can
          earn money from the space that you don't use.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
